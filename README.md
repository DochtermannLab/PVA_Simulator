# PVA_Simulator
Repository for PVA-ish shiny app

Shiny app for PVA simulator for use in an undergraduate ecology course. App built for purposes of introducing students to how stochasticity can influence outcomes for populations. The main issue with the current coding for the time to extinction is that I'm numerically estimating the variance in lambda because I got lazy with the math and had a deadline for getting this ready for class.

First real shiny app I've written so the formatting of the output also needs to be improved.

An example worksheet will be posted shortly.

App can be previewed at: https://dochtermannlab.shinyapps.io/Dochter_PVA/
